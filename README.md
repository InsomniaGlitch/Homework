### Nothing to read here

This program is only created to collect strings that have less than 3 char from the string array in a separate one.


It is completely useless otherwise.


Why read this crap? Go outside, touch some grass, relive human in yourself.


What is resurrection? Is it a process of human soul, human spirit returning to its dead body, recovering it to a living state? Than return you spirit back to this physical world and either enjoy what you've got here or work to achieve something more. We are humans - biological organisms - not to fade away, not to disappear, only leaving a faint, pale trail in the binary world of our fantasies, are we? We all will die one day, as this era comes to an end. Who knows, maybe eons will pass, before new life forms will approach our planet or appear from molecules of protein here? Who knows, how and when it ends? And you don't want to die pathetically, we all want to fight for our survival and we will. Become better, become stronger, develop new skills and improve what you already have, prove this world you were born not to just die, but to make something happen. You may go down in history or may not. You may turn to dust or to gold - it doesn't matter. The only important thing is to, when you will find yourself on the lay of death, be able to say that this life wasn't for nothing. And it all starts when you choose the real world, not digital. It isn't our job to transform our brain into a binary machine of code-building, no. We create programs to bring something to life. Do not drown in this job, as you should't drown in any other. You're doing it for yourself, it's your dreams coming true, it's you who should say he lived for something. And, when we collapse, when a great catastrophe consumes our civilization, some will be remembered, and some forgot. And you want to be one of those, who makes our legacy.


You won't be forgotten in this life if you don't forget about this life. The digital world is made by humans and, as humans ain't eternal, it isn't too. But the physical world is made by nature, by the laws of this universe, by something immortal. Your real life is something you won't get twice.


Set your priorities. Our age is technological - use it to your advantage. This world's story is natural - use it to your advantage too.
